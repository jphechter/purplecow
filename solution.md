# Project Purple Cow - JP Hechter

Welcome to "Project Purple Cow"! This is a submission for Fearless' technical trial project.

This is a web application built using the Angular framework. It provides a simple user interface to 'hit' and display a number of 'hits' on a website.

## Technology Used

- Angular 12.0.3 (Node.js 14.17.0 LTS)
- CountApi.xyz

## Dev Setup

### Prerequisites

To run the application, you must have a local enviroment prepared for Angular development. I recommend checking the Angular documentation for the most up to date information.
[Angular - Getting Started](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)

Angular requires an active LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). If you already have a running version of Node.js, I recommend considering [Node Version Manager or NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install multiple versions of Node.js locally.

### Setup & Local Development

1. Clone this repository to your local machine

2. Install all dependencies
   `npm install`

3. To serve the application simply run
   `ng serve --open` or `npm start`
   Note: Running via npm will not automatically open a new browser window.

4. The app should now be running at: `localhost:3000`
